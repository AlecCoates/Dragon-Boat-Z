# Game Description

<img src="core/assets/example screen for website.png">

Ever wanted to race dragon boats down the River Ouse? 
Of course the answer is yes and we have just the game for you.
DragonBoat Z!

In DragonBoat Z, the player competes against 6 AI opponents, racing their dragon boats across 3 legs to achieve the fastest time to cross the finish line.
Upon starting the game, the player selects 1 of 7 boats as their boat that they would like to race with.
Every boat has 4 statistics with each boat having a different distribution of these staistics.

Robustness
Manouverbility
Max Speed
Acceleration

During the races, there are a series of obstacles that will be floating down the Ouse. The player must avoid these obstacles in order to not damage their boat.
If the boat's durability is reduced to 0 at any point within the game, the game ends and the player loses. So watch out for those geeese!!
Whilst naivigating the obstacles, the player must make sure to stay in their lane to avoid incurring a time penalty.

If the player manages to achieve one of the 3 fastest times across the 3 legs, they will qualify for the final race where they will compete against the other 2 fastest boats.
Upon copmleting the final race, the player will be awarded a medal, bronze, silver, or gold respective to their finsihsing position.
