### Weekly Snapshots

  <summary><strong> Sprint 1 - 08/10/2020 </strong></summary>

Having completed the task of setting up Jira and other resources the main focus was on preparatory work for the 
upcoming week. This involved adding to the existing set of Customer Questions constructed and beginning to develop
of how GitHub Pages works.

<summary><strong> Sprint 2 - 15/10/2020 </strong></summary>

Having had the Customer meeting, this meant that other tasks and deliverables could now be started. The priorities 
were the Architecture Abstract diagram that will be reviewed at the second meeting, halfway through this second 
sprint, as this would allow us to make decisions such as what game library would be used. Deliverables such as 
Method Selection and Planning, Requirements and Risk Assessment were built up using the now known information 
alongside the starting of Sprite Design.

<summary><strong> Sprint 3 - 22/10/2020 </strong></summary>

Having completed the Abstract Architecture Diagram, a focus was put onto the Concrete Architecture Diagram so 
it would be ready for when initial classes are constructed, based off the Gantt Chart. This also meant a decision
was made on the library used for this project: LibGDX. Thus, each team member was assigned the task of completing
the tutorial found in the documentation and further research. Continued deliverable work was assigned a low priority
as this was considered an iterative process throughout the course of the project.

<summary><strong> Sprint 4 - 29/10/2020 </strong></summary>
 
In Sprint 3 the Concrete Architecture was created and allowed for critical tasks to begin: the initial classes. This
was a high priority as delays would impact the production of the prototype on time. Further deliverable work was 
assigned medium/low priority. To maintain a clear separation between work, the initial one board was separated into 
two: Deliverables and Implementation. It was decided that second session of the Sprint would focus on the progression
of these tasks and discuss if any would need to be reassigned.

  <summary><strong> Sprint 5 - 05/11/2020 </strong></summary>
  
The backlog of tasks T14 and T11 were assigned the highest priority, as continued programming work depended on their
completion. With the aim of reaching the milestone M4 at the end of this Sprint the prototype development was a high
focus. Method Section and Planning were a focus within the deliverables board to continue to add to changes within
the project.

<summary><strong> Sprint 6 - 12/11/2020 </strong></summary>

Due to some minor issues with the construction of the leg in the prototype, this task was focused on. Once completed,
we envision that the final tasks to have a functioning game would be successful. Having understood this there was
a focus on the final elements of the programming side. During the second meeting of this sprint, there was extra time
to implement additional functionality of the game such as Animations. 
Alongside this, the implementation document was built up alongside this, allowing us to be more coordinated and 
understand each other's code.

# Game Description

<img src="core/assets/example screen for website.png">

Ever wanted to race dragon boats down the River Ouse? 
Of course the answer is yes and we have just the game for you.
DragonBoat Z!

In DragonBoat Z, the player competes against 6 AI opponents, racing their dragon boats across 3 legs to achieve the fastest time to cross the finish line.

Upon starting the game, the player selects 1 of 7 boats as their boat that they would like to race with.
Every boat has 4 statistics with each boat having a different distribution of these staistics.

## Boat Statistics
- <strong>Robustness</strong>
  - Determines how much damage a boat can take. 
  - A boat with higher robustness will lose a smaller percentage damage to the durability upon collision with an obstacle.
- <strong>Maneuverability</strong>
  - Determines how fast the boat can avoid obstacles. 
  - A boat with higher maneuverability will be able to move side to side better without losing speed.
- <strong>Max Speed</strong>
  - Determines how fast a boat can go. 
  - A boat with higher max speed will be able to go faster than other boats.
- <strong>Acceleration</strong>
  - Determines how quickly a boat can achieve its' max speed. 
  - A boat with higher acceeleration will achieve its max speed before other boats.

## Racing
During the races, there are a series of obstacles that will be floating down the Ouse. The player must avoid these obstacles in order to not damage their boat.
If the boat's durability is reduced to 0 at any point within the game, the game ends and the player loses. So watch out for those geeese!!
Whilst naivigating the obstacles, the player must make sure to stay in their lane to avoid incurring a time penalty.

If the player manages to achieve one of the 3 fastest times across the 3 legs, they will qualify for the final race where they will compete against the other 2 fastest boats.
Upon copmleting the final race, the player will be awarded a medal, bronze, silver, or gold respective to their finsihsing position.
